This project predicts whether the home team wins an nba game using historical game data and machine learning models.

The goal is to build a clean and reproducible ML pipeline, starting with a simple baseline model and improving it over time for educational purpose. 

---

## Problem Statement

Given pre-game information derived from historigal nba games, predict whether the home team will win.

This is a binary classification problem, apply linear regression as a baseline model.

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical nba game data collected from nba_api python library

Raw data is cleaned and transformed into feature-ready datasets before modelling.

All features are constructed using information available **before** the game to avoid data leakage. 

## Features and Target 

To be continued.

---

## Model

A logistic regression **baseline model** is implemented using scikit-learn. 

The baseline serves as a performance benchmark against which more advanced models can be compared. 

---

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Log loss

These metrics capture both prediction correctness and probability quality.
